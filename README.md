# DESCRIPTION üìñ

Shell scripts allow us to program commands in chains and have the system execute them as a scripted event, just like batch files. They also allow for far more useful functions, such as command substitution. You can invoke a command, like date, and use it‚Äôs output as part of a file-naming scheme. You can automate backups and each copied file can have the current date appended to the end of its name. Scripts aren‚Äôt just invocations of commands, either. They‚Äôre programs in their own right. Scripting allows you to use programming functions ‚Äî such as ‚Äòfor‚Äô loops, if/then/else statements, and so forth ‚Äî directly within your operating system‚Äôs interface.

## Testing ‚ö†Ô∏è

- the shell should work like this in interactive mode:

```bash
  $ ./hsh
($) /bin/ls
hsh main.c shell.c
($)
($) exit
$
```

- But also in non-interactive mode:

```bash
  $ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
$ cat test_ls_2
/bin/ls
/bin/ls
$
$ cat test_ls_2 | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
```

## Output üìã

- Unless specified otherwise, our program must have the exact same output as sh (/bin/sh) as well as the exact same error output.
- The only difference is when you print an error, the name of the program must be equivalent to your argv[0] (See below)
  Example of error with sh:

```bash
  $ echo "qwerty" | /bin/sh
/bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/../bin/sh
/bin/../bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
$
```

- Same error with your program hsh:

```bash
 $ echo "qwerty" | ./hsh
./hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
$ echo "qwerty" | ./././hsh
./././hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
$
```
